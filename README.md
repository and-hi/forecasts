# Forecasts
Personal forecasts of future events. Evaluation of my forecasts. 

I want to find out how well I can forecasts and how well calibrated my forecasts are. If you don't know the general idea, see e.g. [metaculus.com](http://www.metaculus.com).

## Covid <a name="covid"></a>

### Third Wave in Germany <a name="third_wave"></a>
I find it fairly likely that there will be some kind of third wave in the next few months.
The first section are my guesses for a third wave that happens in March/April, the next section are for any time in 2021.


#### Quick Third Wave
1. Federal 7-day incidence/100k >= 100 on at least one day before 2021-05-01:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 80% |

2. Federal 7-day incidence/100k >= 155 (first plateau second wave) on at least one day before 2021-05-01:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 60% |

3. Federal 7-day incidence/100k >= 217.64 (peak second wave) on at least one day before 2021-05-01:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 30% |

4. Federal number of Covid patients in ICU >= 5000 according to DIVI/RKI on at least one day before 2021-05-01:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 20% |

#### Third Wave at Any Point this Year 
1. Federal 7-day incidence/100k >= 100 on at least one day before 2021-12-31:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 90% |

2. Federal 7-day incidence/100k >= 155 (first plateau second wave) on at least one day before 2021-12-31:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 70% |

3. Federal 7-day incidence/100k >= 217.64 (peak second wave) on at least one day before 2021-12-31:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 50% |

4. Federal number of Covid patients in ICU >= 5000 according to DIVI/RKI on at least one day before 2021-05-01:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 30% |

### Year End 2021 <a name="year_end"></a>
1. Total case number >= 5,000,000 by 2021-12-31:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 50% |

2. Total case number by 2021-12-31:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | % |

3. Total deaths by 2021-12-31:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | % |

### Mutations <a name="mutations"></a>

1. B 1.1.7 will be the dominant strain by 2021-04-01:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 90% |

2. Another strain will overtake B 1.1.7 after it's dominance before 2021-12-31. Doesn't need to be permanent. Conditional forecasts, only evaluated if B 1.1.7 becomes the dominant strain a some point in time.

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 20% |

### Vaccination Progress <a name="vaccination"></a>

1. Merkel's promise of everyone who wants and is allowed receiving an offer for vaccination by 2021-09-21. I will  interpret this strictly as having received a first dose.:

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 90% |

2. I will have received my (first) vaccine dose by 2021-07-01: 

| Prediction Date | Prediction |
|---|---|
|  2021-03-08 | 80% |

## Evaluation <a name="evaluation"></a>

Nothing to evaluate yet.
